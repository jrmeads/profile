Profile Page for Jason Meads

1: When you acquire the files, to open the main page go to the Home folder, then open the profile.html file. This will pull up the main page. 

2: The Experience section currently has two sections that do not pull up any files. These are projects I have invested in, but have not fully
completed and/or am not ready to share with the public. 

3: The Resume page also needs to be updated. It will soon display more details regarding my work experience.
